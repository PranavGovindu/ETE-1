## Work in Progress Stages

### Current Status

- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Basic documentation
- [x] S3 connection implementation
- [ ] Data ingestion pipeline (In Progress)
- [ ] Data preprocessing implementation (In Progress)
- [ ] Feature engineering (Pending)
- [ ] Model building and training (Pending)
- [ ] Model evaluation (Pending)

- [ ] Integration testing (Pending)
- [ ] Deployment configuration (Pending)

### Next Steps

1. Complete data ingestion pipeline
   - Implement data validation
   - Add data quality checks
   - Set up automated data updates

2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Implement data cleaning functions
   - Create feature transformation pipeline
   - Add feature selection methods

3. Model Development
   - Train initial model
   - Implement cross-validation
   - Add hyperparameter tuning
   - Create model evaluation metrics

4. API and Deployment
   - Complete Flask API implementation
   - Add API documentation
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure model serving
